Broadwater Geothermal District Heating Production Scenarios for Replication and Modification

These files are from the initial iteration of GEOPHIRES production scenarios created at Broadwater Hot Springs, Montana. The production scenarios were stringent and do not necessarily reflect maximum potentials or ideal temperature differentials at the wellheads. I encourage others to use these production scenarios and modify the flow, geothermal gradients, reservoir sizes, etc., to benefit future production at the resource area.

Note: The "percentage of heat mined" by year in the GEOPHIRES output files will become negative in these scenarios. Broadwater is a fracture-fed geothermal surface manifestation and this GEOPHIRES output is only based on the assumption of a closed (non-fracture-fed) reservoir. Please ignore that output imbalance. 

The products found here are the result of a master's thesis, in part funded by the Fulbright Commission of Iceland.

Added line to production text files for the linear thermal drawdown model used. When not set, this value defaults to 0.5%. See for more details:
