Broadwater District Heating Production Scenarios for Replication and Modification

These files are from the initial iteration of GEOPHIRES production scenarios created at Broadwater Hot Springs, Montana. The production scenarios were stringent and do not necessarily reflect maximum potentials or ideal temperature differentials at the wellheads. I encourage others to use these production scenarios and modify the flow, geothermal gradients, reservoir sizes, etc., to benefit future production at the resource area.

The products found here are the result of a master's thesis, in part funded by the Fulbright Commission of Iceland.

Added line to production text files for the linear thermal drawdown model used. When not set, this value defaults to 0.5%. See for more details:
